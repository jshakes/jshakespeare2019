I’ve been making websites and other digital products for over a decade. I specialize in front-end web technologies, which means I spend most of my time writing code with languages like JavaScript. I particularly enjoy working at the intersection of design and code; in my experience they are usually two sides of the same coin.

I’m a strong proponent of [human-centered design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmM0kRf8Dbk&vl=en). When we set out to make a product, we are embracing an opportunity to make the user’s life better. That is an exciting job to have!

I've worked in a wide range of settings, including startups like [Taptap Send](https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/taptap-send-raises-65m-to-build-cross-border-remittances-focused-on-the-most-underserved-markets/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAF18x7dqKE1LTskI4iiCxulTYo2AIp0APMmPJy_f4PdNVdEh2ZcEdOQMd5D6ec1XErTezzVRRl9E603RLPWTSCSqH0D1BQnXsiRRI15PJymsvuGXWPs88nBQtRo6xYRBfVwt-8SsZhqH2pJjj_12niXJAVbceXlcgrreQ8bU6ldY) and [Quartz](https://qz.com), and design agencies where I built things for companies like Time magazine, British Airways, BMW and Volkswagen.

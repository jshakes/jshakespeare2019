I have over a decade of experience building software at startup, agency, and freelance roles. I specialize in writing code using languages like JavaScript and frameworks like React.js, but I'm often also involved in shaping the design and user experience of the things I build.

I'm currently accepting freelance contracts. You should [email me](mailto:j@jshakespeare.com) if you need a product engineering specialist for your next project.
